summary: |
  Prior to September 6, 2022, the AWS AppSync service could be coerced to assume arbitrary roles which trusted the AppSync service. This was due to insufficient validation of a serviceRoleArn parameter, allowing an attacker to specify roles in other accounts. With this vulnerability, an adversary could invoke arbitrary AWS API calls with the compromised role.
